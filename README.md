### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the milkman, my milk is delicious, and I'm a freshman year computer science student. Right now I'm trying to learn the basics of web development to become (hopefully) a full-stack dev. My favorite language right now is JavaScript which is also the language I hate the most.

(hopefully this will get better lol)
